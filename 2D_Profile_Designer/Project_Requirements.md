## 2. Functional Requirements
- ### Hem Logic
  - [ ] When an angle of less than 20 degrees is inputed, ask if they want to make a Hem or not. if yes, make the window pop up. 
  - [ ] No dedicated button, have it automatically have a Hem creation pop up window where they will put in the necessary information. 
  - [ ] Choose whether it is Open or Closed Hem. If open, by how much. Closed, no extra information. 
  - [ ] Length of Hem. How many inches is it? 
  - [ ] The two lines that make up the hem combine to create a visual Hem effect. Maybe delete the second line that triggered the Hem window and just make the end of the other line Thicker?
- ### Image Saving
  - [ ] When the profile is done, allow image download/creation with all the coorosponding information. 
- ### Line rules
  - [ ] Lines cannot cross. 
  - [ ] Lines snap to perfect horizontal or vertical so that it looks flush and even with the borders of the canvas.
